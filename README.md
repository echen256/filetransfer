This application is intended to provide simple file transfer functionality 
between two devices utilizing websockets connections. 

However, one branch (model-viewer) was repurposed for making a demonstrator for a company I applied to. 
The demonstrator app uses Three.js to render a collection of points and the minimum spanning tree connecting 
all of them. The user can toggle various settings on the page. The page is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and can 
be visited via my github profile. 

The original file transfer application is still under development.
